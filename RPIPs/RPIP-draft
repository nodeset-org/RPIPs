# KISS Saturn Upgrades

## Motivation
The recent slide in the RPL/ETH ratio has caused pain across the entire Rocket Pool (RP) community. In response, the pDAO has reawakened tokenomics discussions with the goals of improving efficiency and attractiveness of RP, with seemingly anything on the table. The quantity of ideation is impressive, but there are significant and serious risks associated with full tokenomics transformations, and we believe there are better paths available to pursue the same objectives.

## Abstract
We propose using existing protocol parameters alongside well-understood ideas to upgrade the protocol as follows: 
1) Megapools[[1](https://github.com/nodeset-org/RPIPs/blob/main/RPIPs/RPIP-43.md),[2](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool-research/blob/ef5b5627f02a2307e11915236f98b130ef779cf1/Megapools/megapools.md)]
2) A flat application of LEB4 minipools with reduced RPL bonding requirements
3) Forced exits for underperforming validators

Together, the proposed changes make up a "Saturn I" protocol upgrade, with future potential changes in "Saturn II" and "Saturn III" suggested but with the specification left for future documents.

## Specification
### Megapools
The specification for Megapools is defined in [RPIP-43](https://github.com/nodeset-org/RPIPs/blob/main/RPIPs/RPIP-43.md).
### LEB4s


## Risk Analysis
### Technical Risks
As always, when editing existing contracts which are live on mainnet, there is a significant technical risk of exploitation, bugs, or other unintentional errors in execution. We recommend the community continue to maintain high standards by engaging multiple third-party auditors before effectuating these changes. However, the changes presented here are well-studied and minimal, especially compared to competing proposals such as [RPIPs 42 through 48 -- SPECIFY MORE].

### Forced Exits During Inactivity Leaking
The Ethereum staking formula includes additional penalties for offline validators when large portions of the network are offline. This state of accelerated punishment is called "inactivity leaking". With the RP protocol forcing exits for validators under a 31.5 ETH balance, validators who are offline during an inactivity leaking scenario may be exited even if the validator is only offline for a brief period. In some extreme scenarios, a small number of missed attestations could cause a validator to be ejected from the network. This may be necessary, however, in order to protect the value of rETH during an unusual network state for Ethereum. 

## Suggested Development Roadmap
### Saturn I
### Saturn II
### Saturn III
